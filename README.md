# Customer Churn
In this project, we use banking data to predict whether a customer will churn using different ML models.

Note: The dataset used in this project from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adacert/churn/main/Churn_Modelling has been cleaned and formatted for this particular project. The "Churn_PyCaret" file contains EDA and the complete ML pipeline.
